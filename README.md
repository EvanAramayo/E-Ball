# E-Ball

Hola mi cielo, this is a hunt to find the message of me asking you out to E-Ball. I thought this would be helpful since you need to learn Github for your research lab. As you go through the repository and my code you'll obtain a better understanding of Githib (and hopefully think I'm hot.) Love you mi Copa Mundial. MWAH!!!

First thing go to issues on top bar of github

## What github is 

Basically what Github is, is an online repository or storage for code and projects for people to review, share, and work on. Also I'm RELLLY hungry as im writing this. 

Codeword: Codeword (the codeword is codeword)
